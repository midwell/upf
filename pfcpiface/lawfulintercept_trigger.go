// The UPF is a triggered CC-POI: it does not learn about warrants from the ADMF.
// The CC Triggering Function in the SMF tasks it over LI_T3, which TS 33.128
// clause 5.2.6 realises as ETSI TS 103 221-1 with the CC-TF in the role of the
// "ADMF" and this CC-POI in the role of the "NE". Each trigger names the PFCP
// session to intercept and carries what the datapath cannot know: the warrant XID
// to label content with, the correlation identifier that joins it to the SMF's
// signalling, and where to deliver it.
//
// The PFCP DUPL apply-action remains the mechanism that replicates packets;
// this interface supplies the identity of what is replicated. The
// two therefore arrive over different interfaces and can disagree — content whose
// session has no trigger must not be delivered, since it could only be labelled
// with an XID no mediation function can attribute.

// startTriggerListener binds the LI_T3 triggering interface and returns the task
// store the shipper matches duplicated content against.
//
// The bind is synchronous so a failure reaches the caller: a CC-POI that looks
// enabled but can never be tasked performs no interception, and the whole point
// of failing closed here is that this is not discoverable from the outside.
// Nothing is logged — that this NE can be tasked at all must not appear in a
// general operator log.
// probes are the conditions this element can be asked about — the shipper's, since the
// knowledge is the shipper's. They are passed in rather than built here because this
// function owns the interface and not the delivery.
